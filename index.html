      <h2>Basketball</h2>
      <p>
        Basketball is one of my favourites things to do. Although I'm not so
        great at it, I still enjoy playing it. Basketball is a sport where
        people use a round ball to score points. If you shoot outside the
        semi-circle it's worth 3 points, anywhere else is a 2 unless it's a
        foul, then it's a 1.

      <h2>Cats</h2>
      <p>
        Cats are demosticated feline creatures. They are pets and loved around
        the world. Cats are wonderful to have around.
